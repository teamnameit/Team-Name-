											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p></p><p>NAME: Colin Madusanka Jayasekara.</p><p></p>
										
									<p>STUDENT ID: S3670061</p><p>EMAIL: S3670061@student.rmit.edu.au</p><p>DATE OF BIRTH: 21/08/1996</p><p>My name is Colin Madusanka Jayasekara but my full name is Jayasekara Mudiyanselage Colin Madusanka Jayasekara which happens to be title given by kings to those who are loyal to the throne, I was born on 21st August 1996. My Student ID is S3670061 and my email is S3670061@student.rmit.edu.au.</p><p>I am a Sri Lankan born in Colombo, Sri Lanka and I was born to a Buddhist family, hence I am classified as a Buddhist. I am a 23-year-old Male with a height of 173cm (or 5’8) and I am currently living in Melbourne, Australia attending The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) studying for my Bachelors of Engineering in Aerospace Engineering, I am due to complete my course in 2021 and I hope to be working in a aerospace company or start my own in Australia or Sri Lanka, I also speak 2 languages Sinhala and English and I am also open to learning more languages.</p><p>Hobbies:


</p><p>My favorite hobbies include Playing games, watching videos on YouTube and Daydreaming about multitudes of possibilities that might/might not occur. I also like to research random things on the internet when it comes to my mind, like how to code in Python or how to make mini Drones/Rockets or watching any other sort of documentary that I feel like intrigues or interests me.

											<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
										</header>
										<p></p><li>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</li><p></p>
										
									<p>I take interest in the formation of the ‘internet’ and how it went from a luxury afforded by some to an everyday staple component of every household, Business and personal life of the current populous. I also took interest in how such a vast database exists and how it was powered in a way which allowed the entirety of the planet to be connected to the same information filled databases at the same time regardless of the time and place of viewing. I was small when I came into contact with the internet and I was very interested in games where I would spend hours playing or searching for the right kind of games which is where my interest of IT started, I also went onto realize that games and just basic information was not the only thing I could obtain and with the school curriculum aiding me in IT and my own curiosity leading me to dive more into the world of the internet, I would go on to learn the best ways as well as tips and tricks on how to best get information which are still useful methods to me personally today.</p><p>An event that sparked my further interest of the internet was my obsession with Aliens and all related Extraterrestrial events that may or may not have happened around the world, it even went to an extent where my entire family was going through the internet with to find ’definitive’ evidence of Alien life out in the universe or visits by them to our planet. Overall my experience with IT and everything related from the internet, computers to academic and workplace uses and my vested time in the world of IT has shown me the Pros and Cons of the use if IT, I know how to get information, which to use and which not to use and also where to avoid to stay out of unnecessary trouble. I have made friends who without IT and its marvel would have continued be strangers forever. I am truly grateful for all that the world of IT has allowed me to achieve until now.</p><li>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</li><p>.</p><p>RMIT had the degree I wanted to pursue and it also was in Australia which is a country I preferred going to compared to America due to safety and distance between the 2 countries. RMIT showed competency when it came to taking care of its students, also the facilities provided and those that were under construction showed great promise of helping me in my academic activities and hence decide that the best course of action was to take my future and have it nurtured at RMIT. I hope I get to a good position in Life and I my career with the degree I hope to obtain in 2021.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><li>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</li><p>.
</p><p>I am doing BEng in Aerospace Engineering with Introduction to IT an 2nd year elective, therefore I’m hoping to get all resources and experience in my core course which is Aerospace engineering while also growing better and more competence in IT area which will allow me to hopefully stand out more from my peers due to its importance in current day and age and also with the experience and knowledge this will course provide me with which I will be able to apply in my work life and help further my career.

										<p></p>link: https://rollsroyce.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/professional/job/Indianapolis/Vice-President-of-Strategic-Capture_JR6051910?source=APPLICANT_SOURCE-3-73<p></p>
										
									<p>The position I have found is in the aerospace sector at Rolls Royce and the position is Vice President of Strategic Capture in America which essentially means is that as the VP of Strategic Capture, the individual will be required to make and find winning strategies that would win the company more deals and expansion space of the business when it comes to contracts where good relationships with the ‘right’ people that would be needed to stand out from the competition. Further responsibilities will require the individual to create, monitor and review approved Proposals each week and also being the decision maker and control point of all essential development and Pricing teams under the position of VP as well as managing internal capture projects as well as external ones in other parts of the company and country. This position appeals to me since I feel like I would be able to better balance the needs of the Engineers with the requirements of the investors which in all aerospace companies have seen a more imbalance towards the requirements of the investors without genuinely inquiring into the issues and constrains the engineers are facing.</p><p>The posting states that a Bachelor’s degree is a basic requirement with over 12 years (preferably) experience as well over 10 years’ experience with a master’s degree and a JD/PhD with over 6 years’ experience with a US Citizenship. Therefore, the applicant must have over 15 years of experience in the same field or related sector with thorough knowledge in managing teams and large scale projects that expand countrywide and also with experience in dealing with defense departments and related law enforcement authorities.</p><p>I currently have no work experience whatsoever and therefore lack any actual experience in the Aerospace sector or in any sector whatsoever, However I have experience in working in teams for university group projects and I have been a team player and have taken my respective load for each group I’m placed in and I am hoping to take charge with upcoming group projects by being the team leader. I am currently on my second semester of my 2nd year at RMIT where I’m continuing to study Aerospace engineering and hopefully by next year I would employed at a workplace in Melbourne.</p><p>I plan to obtain these required skills by completing my Bachelors and Master’s degree at RMIT while obtaining some work experience in the related field and then to go to a full time job at an aerospace company where I will work up from the entry Aerospace Engineer position while obtaining further knowledge on the subject as well as making connections with higher industry individuals and expanding my exposure as a candidate to other companies in the sector as well as the company higher-up individuals. </p><p></p></div></div>

<img src="./Stellar by HTML5 UP_files/big 5.PNG" alt="visual" width="600" height="455">
								<p>These test results show that I am capable of achieving my goals although there are some things that I must fix in order to get to my desired job position faster, where I would need to immerse myself in team discussions and be more vocal and outgoing when it comes to socializing as it will lead to connecting with important people in my area of work which can boost my probabilities of moving up the hierarchical chain.</p>
								<p>These test results indicate that I would work well in teams and that I would be fit to be a team leader if and when needed to be, therefore I believe that my personal skills might be valuable as I would be able to coordinate tasks and overall goal accomplishments as I apparently have a good ability to understand individuals which means that I would be able to divide tasks up between people according to what I believe would be their individual strengths thus making a more effective and efficient team.</p>
								<p>I don’t worry too much about what team I end up with since I won’t be able to choose which team members I can work with when I get a job and hence I would be required to work with whoever is there. Due to this I would try to take tasks that would fit my personal skills like creativity better, I will try to do parts of the project that would be a lot easier for me to accomplish so as to not inconvenience the entire team thus reducing efficiency.</p>

											<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
										</header>
										<p></p><p>Overview:</p><p></p>
										
									<p>The project I am pursuing is an all-device application that allows people in Engineering Universities, Jobs and Research &amp; Development centers to quickly solve all sorts of engineering related questions by using the App that will have a library of every equation used with the ability to visualize their obtained results through graphs and related figures as an option to better understand the output. This app will have a simplified app surface with the option of selecting an advanced version in order to input their own raw values in its entirety if they wished to.</p><p>Motivation: </p><p>From a general persons view this app may seem boring, but for millions of engineers from all disciplines and experience levels out their this will be a timesaver as it cuts down the time wasted on typing the equations onto the calculator with the entire equation format which could have been better utilized for other works. I am a university student who has a low-tech calculator that doesn’t have the latest capabilities of pre-set equations where I only have to input my values, which takes completing my math intensive assignments 2 to 3 times longer than others with better calculators.</p><p>Description: </p><p>The app will be available on desktop with full support for Android and Apple Operating systems across all devices and it will also have all of the mathematical equations (millions of them) stored in a cloud server which can be accessed by thousands at a time, The App interface for each equation will be simplified with an option at the bottom that allows an “Advanced Mode” to be activated where the preset values of certain figures that are considered a ‘constant’ can be changed to own desired values with additional abilities to control the decimal/Significant figures output for results as well an in-built scanner that can identify the name of a handwritten equation if the user were to not remember the name of the equation type.</p><p>The app will allow those who are new to engineering to also have an understanding of what they calculated by using the graphs and figures that come below the results output section which will also show how the answer was obtained step-by-step that would also help those who are at an academic level to understand how the equation results are obtained and how to understand them.
</p><p>The app will have a built-In scanner that will scan equations off most surfaces with app updates that would make the function as well as the entire app more user-friendly to use as the months go by. we expect crashes to occur at the initial stages right after app launch on all app stores as well as glitches and issues with user access of the cloud server if and when the number of users increases. We also expect to get issues with the scanning feature which might vary results depending on the camera quality of the phone used as well as the surface off which it is trying to scan the equation from, but we expect to give monthly updates for all features of our app to make sure that the inconvenience faced by users are at a minimum.The app interface will be simple where as you enter the app a search bar at the top will be seen which you can manually search equations for and a camera button next to it which will be the scan function and in the middle will be a quick use list that shows all the equations the user has used in recent times and if it’s your first time using the app then a guide on how to use the app and functions that are available with prompt you to follow instructions on what the app can do and how to navigate around the app. It will also have a report button right below the middle section that will allow people to send crash and glitch data on the app when it detects a crash in its system, the data will be sent to our analysis team that will find root cause and follow up with updates by the end of the month. The app will also support advertisements for revenue.
</p><p>.</p><p>Tools and Technology: </p><p>The tools required to carry out this development will require using Xcode and Swift for both Android and Apple platform uses since we are trying to make our application compatible will all OS systems. We will also take advantage of open source tools such as Krita and Notepad++ for making aesthetically pleasing graphics for our apps that would give it its modern yet user0friendly look at first glance which will bring in users to try our app out. Other tools include Appcelerator and PhoneGap which will help us make the app with less obstacles.</p><p>.</p><p>Skills Required: </p>The development of this application will require individuals with extensive knowledge in using Xcode and Swift for different operating platforms while others require experience in Krita and Notepad++ for the graphics of the app and its pages as well as good in using PhoneGap and Appcelerator open source tools. It will be relatively costly to have all individuals together at once since the level of competence needed from any of these tools will require a high wage, however the employment of university students on this endeavor will bring down costs effectively. <p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="content">

											<h2>Outcome: </h2>
										</header>
										<p></p><p>If this application becomes successful, then we will be able to continue to add more features and make its functionality a lot better or we can sell it to the highest bidder for them to use to integrate into their own services. The original issues regarding cloud traffic and expected crashes and scan issues can be reduced by buying more space on cloud servers as well as employing teams dedicated to fixing errors and making updates that will make the use of this app much better and intuitive for the users.</p>
