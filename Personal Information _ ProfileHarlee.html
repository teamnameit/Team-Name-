<p><strong>Name</strong>: Harlee Horng</p>

<p><strong>Student Number</strong>: s3717748</p>

<p><strong>Email Address</strong>: Harlee_horng1999@hotmail.com</p>

<p>My name is Harlee Horng, born in Australia in the year of 1999. My nationality is Cambodian as both of my parents are from there. When I was younger, my parents were firm believers of the Buddhism religion, therefore, so was my older sister and me. We would attend events held at the temple on occasions, including the major Chinese New Year festival which took place annually. By the age of 8, I was able to speak the Cambodian language (Khmer) fluently, but the ability to speak it faded away as I grew up and now, I am only able to understand it. Growing up, my family consisted of my mum, dad, sister and me. This changed in the year of 2014, when my dad remarried. A year after the marriage, a little stepsister joined our family who is currently 4 years old and currently attending kindergarten. I had a standard education like most other people, consisting of; kindergarten, primary school, high school and now currently studying at university. I graduated in the year of 2017 with a low ATAR, which required me to complete a year of a diploma course before transferring to a bachelors degree at RMIT. I acquired my first job at Maccas whilst I was in year 12 and I am still working there right now. As soon as I had enough money to afford a decent computer, I spent all my savings that I had at the time to build my computer. My hobby is playing video games on my PC. One specific game that I enjoy the most is ‘League of Legends’ which I have played consistently and constantly for 6 years.</p>

<p>An interesting fact about me is that I got detention on my first week of primary school because I chased other students around with a stick. Oddly enough, my personality has shifted drastically from when I was a child to now. I used to be confident and outgoing, contrasted to how I am now - which is quiet, introverted and anti-social.</p>

<h3 id="interest-in-it">Interest in IT</h3>

<p>Information technology has always been intriguing to me even as a child due to my passion of playing games.  I currently have little to no IT experience as the only IT related lesson I’ve undertaken was in year 10 of high school as an elective. I believe that the tv show “The IT Crowd” made a career in IT seem interesting, as it appeared as what my ideal job would look like.</p>

<p>The main reason why I chose to come to RMIT was because many of my cousins had gone to RMIT in the past or are currently studying here and recommended that it was a great university to study at. Also, with RMIT located in the city, it is a change of pace from my previous learning institutions of primary and high school. Thus, it makes for an exciting new experience of travelling to the city on a weekly basis for school via train.</p>

<p>During my studies at RMIT university, I expect to acquire knowledge, skills and qualifications in the I.T field in order to prepare myself for a future career within the field of I.T. I believe that over the course of my studies, I will also learn other skills, such as; communication, decision-making, problem-solving, teamwork and time management skills.</p>

<h3 id="ideal-job">Ideal Job</h3>

<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/39630732?searchrequesttoken=099b6bbf-f8bf-4c3d-8aee-b38cfeca8776&amp;type=standout</p>

<p><img src="./Personal Information _ ProfileHarlee_files/1step.png" alt="Job"></p>

<p>The advertised IT job involves working in a team environment and collaborating with different departments of the business, assisting with any issues regarding IT. This involves; managing and attending to tickets daily and performing all assigned tasks, responding to all phone calls, tickets and or emails received and providing excellent customer service in a fast and efficient manner. The working hours of this I.T support job is from 8:30am to 5pm for a total of 5 days a week from Monday to Friday. Three days of which will be at a customer site, while the other two days will be spent in the office. This is appealing to me as it allows for a variety of work in different spaces with reasonable hours. The advertisement does not explicitly display the salary rate for the job; however, similar jobs offer a pay of approximately 50k a year. 1step communication’s Melbourne support centre is in Port Melbourne, which is 40 minutes away from the CBD.</p>

<p>The requirements of this position in terms of skills, qualifications and experiences include having; 1 to 3 years of prior experience working on a help desk, a completed or nearly completed course relating to IT, a strong understanding of the operating systems and other computer knowledge and effective communication skills.</p>

<p>The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have including; being able to cooperatively work in a team, remaining calm under pressure, basic communication skills, basic computer skills and completion of high school. While working at my current place of employment – McDonalds, it is crucial to be able to work together as a team and to use communication effective to successfully and efficiently complete all tasks at hand. Additionally, the store may become extremely busy at any time of the day, which requires the ability to remain level-headed and to persevere through the constant orders. I also have decent computer skills of using software such as; Microsoft word, excel, presentation, etc.</p>

<p>Due to the specifications of the IT job requiring prior knowledge of help desk jobs, I’d have to start off with an IT job which requires no prior experience or perhaps apply as an intern to an IT job. In regard to needing a course degree, I am currently working towards it as I am in my first year of studying a bachelors degree of information technology at the moment, which would result in acquiring a strong understanding of computers and its operations. Along with learning the contents of the course, I believe that throughout the course, I’d be able to develop my communication skills to be able to communicate effectively to customers in my future career.</p>

<h3 id="personal-profile">Personal Profile</h3>

<p><img src="./Personal Information _ ProfileHarlee_files/t3.png" alt="Test3"></p>

<p>The results of these tests show that I am introverted and prefer to work independently. They convey that I take a more observant approach to group work and participate with low levels of openness.  I believe that because I am more inclined to agree with people, it would cause less disruption and arguments in a team. As a result, I feel that I would be a good group member in terms of completing my part of the project. Regarding forming a team, I think it would be best to group up with people with the same or similar attributes as I have.</p>

<h3 id="project-ideas">Project Ideas</h3>

<p>My project idea is to create a free-to-download smartphone app which connects to the PC game “League of Legends” and allows you to find other players in the vicinity based on your location. The app will allow players to chat or call with people living in the same area, allowing people to make friends via the smartphone app. By giving users the option to find other users in the same area, it would give them the opportunity to make friends in real life and not just online friends.</p>

<p>‘League of Legends’ is one of the most played video games in the world with over 27 million players every single day. Some people may have a hard time finding friends whether it’s at school or at a social event and some people may just be looking to find some new friends. In any case, this creation allows for people to find friends with a common interest and build everlasting relationships. With the player base of the game being extremely large, it provides a platform for people to connect to the extent that users choose. Similarly, to Facebook, it is a social media platform wherein strangers can be introduced to each other and then communicate with one another. In this instance, ‘League of Legends’ players will commune with other players, thus already having a common interest to talk about.</p>

<p>This apps’ intention is alike to the smartphone friendship app called ‘Bumble’, where someone can find other people to talk to and become friends with within the same area. The difference between these apps is that this smartphone app will require users to sign in using their legitimate ‘League of Legends’ account details in order to log into the app. This is because the app is targeted mainly towards the colossal player base of ‘League of Legends’ players.  Users are then prompted to allow permission to location in order to locate other players in the vicinity. For security reasons, the location provided by users will not be displayed for other users to see. The app will find players within a radius of either 2/6/10KM around the location. The radius can be changed at any time to suit the users’ preference to scan for players both near and far. After the location is given, a list of players within the area will appear, along with their ‘League of Legends’ account details. Users must first mutually add each other as ‘friends’ before they message people. This is to prevent any spam or unwanted messages. Players that are added in the smartphone app are also added in the game to allow for communication on PC as well as on mobile. Users can then message players and request to play games or just simply chat. Along with the messaging function, there is a call function which allows players to talk using voice chat. Users may also use the app for voice chatting whilst playing ‘League of Legends’ together. Whilst many players of the game may use a voice chat program such as discord or skype, they may now also use this app if they want to. The app will optionally issue notifications when someone sends a message, or when someone nearby has joined the smartphone app. To avoid the app being intrusive, the notifications can be toggled on or off in the settings. Like many other social media platforms, such as Facebook or Tinder, there are risks associated with using the smartphone app. One of these risks could include associating with a dangerous person or data being leaked. However, it is an uncontrollable risk that everyone takes when using social media sites and apps.</p>

<p>Software such as an ‘app builder’ app could be used to build the application. A hardware tool that would be necessary for the app is the touchscreen. The touchscreen is very much needed as it allows users to interact and navigate the app, essentially to be able to use the app. The app would also require the use of GPS, as the app needs a pinpoint of the phones location to search for other participants. Microphone permission would also be necessary for use of the voice chat function of the app. It allows for users to communicate with others via talking as opposed to typing. As the operations of this project depends of the availability of use of ‘League of Legends’ login information, we may be required to request for the use of that for our smartphone app.</p>

<p>To create the smartphone app, we would need to know how to design and build a high-quality user interface (UI). Elements of a well-designed UI will be easy to navigate, quick loading and smooth operating. The app should also be able to run on androids as well as iPhones, as it shouldn’t just be limited to one type of mobile platform. The app should have a high level of security to ensure that there isn’t a security breach and that no personal information is leaked. Another important skill is the knowledge of modern language programming skills. This may include; commonly used programming languages, web development languages, application programming interfaces and use of cross-platform mobile suites. The app should also be advertised to win over potential customers who may be thinking of using a social search app to find friends. The differentiation between this app and other social search apps is that this one is specifically targeted towards the ‘League of Legends’ community. I believe that it would be quite achievable to locate people who would be able to assist in the creation of this project as many people in the IT field would be familiar with these types of knowledge and would be adept with these skills.</p>

<p>If this project is successful, it will help people in search for friends to find them and as a result of these newfound friends, it could develop their communication skills to help them find more friends in the future. The original problem of friends being difficult to find is solved as the app can find the friends for the user with minimal effort. So long as people can form friendships using the app, this app can be deemed a success.</p>
