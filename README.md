My favorite hobbies include playing games, watching videos on YouTube and daydreaming about multitudes of possibilities that might/might not occur. I also like to research random things on the internet when it comes to my mind, like how to code in Python or how to make mini Drones/Rockets or watching any other sort of documentary that I feel like intrigues or interests me. Our team name for this project is “Team Name” since we thought it would be ironic and deadpan funny for a team to have such a name.

## Harlee

**Name**: Harlee Horng

**Student Number**: s3717748

**Email Address**: s3717748@student.rmit.edu.au

**Date of Birth**: 26/12/1999

My name is Harlee Horng, born in Australia in the year of 1999. My nationality is Cambodian as both of my parents are from there. When I was younger, my parents were firm believers of the Buddhism religion, therefore, so was my older sister and me. We would attend events held at the temple on occasions, including the major Chinese New Year festival which took place annually. By the age of 8, I was able to speak the Cambodian language (Khmer) fluently, but the ability to speak it faded away as I grew up and now, I am only able to understand it. Growing up, my family consisted of my mum, dad, sister and me. This changed in the year of 2014, when my dad remarried. A year after the marriage, a little stepsister joined our family who is currently 4 years old and currently attending kindergarten. I had a standard education like most other people, consisting of; kindergarten, primary school, high school and now currently studying at university. I graduated in the year of 2017 with a low ATAR, which required me to complete a year of a diploma course before transferring to a bachelor's degree at RMIT. I acquired my first job at Maccas whilst I was in year 12 and I am still working there right now. As soon as I had enough money to afford a decent computer, I spent all my savings that I had at the time to build my computer. My hobby is playing video games on my PC. One specific game that I enjoy the most is ‘League of Legends’ which I have played consistently and constantly for 6 years.

An interesting fact about me is that I got detention on my first week of primary school because I chased other students around with a stick. Oddly enough, my personality has shifted dramatically from when I was a child. I used to be confident and outgoing, contrasted to how I am now - which is quiet, introverted and antisocial.

**Name**: Andy Lo

**Student Number**: s3599772

**Email Address**: s359772@student.rmit.edu.au

**Date of Birth**: 17/08/1997

My name is Andy Lo, was born in August of 1997. My Student ID is S399772 and my email is S3599772@student.rmit.edu.au. My family is Catholic so attending church on Sunday was a childhood memory for me. I came from Hong Kong to Australia to attend high school and then to RMIT. During this year, I will graduate from bachelor and seek for accounting job. My favourite food is noodles. My hobbies include watching YouTube videos and play mobile games. If there is more time on holiday period, I may travel to a suburb near my home and take a refreshing walk. Our group tried to think of a team name related to Asian as we have a connection with that. Even so, “Team Name” is better, I believe without any specific reason.

## Group Processes
Our group worked remarkably with access to Facebook messenger to communicate progress on our individually assigned roles as well as a google drive repository set for all members to submit their work and eventually add together into one document. We had a positive attitude throughout the project and accepted all types of inputs and ideas without judgement. Despite one of our group members disappearing out of the blue, the rest of us worked hard on our respective roles and completed our project collaboratively. I believe that we worked well together due to our access to the messenger app as it allowed us to message one another at any time for a quick response. 

## Career Plans
All our ideal jobs involve; working in a team environment, good communication skills and knowledge of IT skills relevant to each job. We had differing jobs from one another. Harlee aims towards an ‘IT Support help desk job’ in the IT field, whereas Andy wants to become an ‘Accounts Officer’ which is in the accounting field and Colin wishes to become a ‘Vice-President of Strategic Capture’ in the engineering field. 

Each of our jobs are in different fields and require different amounts of experience in order to achieve them. While Harlee and Andy aim for a job with minimal previous experience (less than 3 years) to attain them, Colin wishes to end up with a job as vice president which requires passion to gain approximately 15 years of previous experience in the field. A position such as vice-president of a company would most likely be a job high in demand as it is high on the job hierarchy with many benefits; such as job security, good pay, etc. An ‘Accounts Officer’ job is another job which ranks highly in terms of demand.
With Harlee’s ideal job being the only job based in the IT field he requires many skills sets of IT-specific skills. These include many of the top listed skills in high demand such as; SQL, Java, JavaScript, Microsoft Windows, etc. Andy’s job is based in the accounting field; however, he would also require IT-specific skills such as how to operate basic computer programs. Microsoft Windows, Project management and Building relationships is high on the list of skill demand. As an engineer, Colin would need require skills in graphic design, which is ranked lower on the list compared to the other skills required for the other two jobs. In general, communication skills are required for all our ideal jobs as communication is important in teams of sought and demanded. Other general skills we would all need is problem solving, teamwork and planning.

Group Website: [Group](https://teamnameit.github.io/TeamName/) 

Github Respository: [Repository](https://github.com/teamnameit/TeamName) 

Based on our success with assignment 2, using Google Drive as our repository, we decided to use it once again for our third assignment. We used GitHub to store pictures we needed to implement onto our website, however we used google drive in conjunction with google docs files in order to collaboratively construct our group project. We set up an ‘IT project’ folder which was shared to all members, as well as designating roles to everyone to ensure everyone knew what to do. We decided that google docs was the best option as it was a familiar repository that all group members were familiar with and knew how to operate. Using google docs made it easier for others to view and amend anything that needs changing. Also, we had a group chat on Facebook messenger which we used to keep everyone on track and allowed for any communication needed between members regarding the project. These tools assisted in setting goals and a timeline to give us a clear vision of where we were headed in terms of project progress. We suggested many kinds of ideas during our discussions but fortunately we were still able to concentrate without disruptions or conflict. The settlement for the idea requires patience and research in our personal time. The fact that we were able to work smoothly throughout the course of the project shows how level of commitment and teamwork.
 

# Group Reflection

**What went well**
The group members did their allocated sections well and within the given time, The report formation and other related tasks such as interviews were successfully completed thanks to the group members, we were able to push through even with only 4 active members without too much of a hassle. The teamwork of this group was excellent, where each member took the initiative in getting the due tasks done even with other course assignments and projects due at the same time.

**What could be improved**
If all group members were in constant contact that would reduce the inconveniences faced by the whole team since one absent member will mean more work being allocated to everyone else which is unfair and with the high workloads already placed I believe it is imperative that each member carry their own weight, including myself.

**At least one thing that was surprising**
The level of expertise required to make any of our project ideas become a reality, the factors we have to consider as well as figuring out how to start in making this project idea. The software and the complexity of the idea determined if the project was actually achievable within the given timespan.

**At least one thing that you have learned about groups**
The level of responsibility a team leader must have is immense, there's alot of factors to consider as well as obstacles faced during the course of this project, and finding answers when you are placed on the spot as a team leader is anxiety-inducing as well as requiring a high level of tolerance and patience. All of which will be tested throughout the course of this project. Teamwork is also paramount to the successful completion of any project and without teamwork, the overall morale and efficiency of the group lowers which affects team performance.
