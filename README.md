My favorite hobbies include playing games, watching videos on YouTube and daydreaming about multitudes of possibilities that might/might not occur. I also like to research random things on the internet when it comes to my mind, like how to code in Python or how to make mini Drones/Rockets or watching any other sort of documentary that I feel like intrigues or interests me. Our team name for this project is “Team Name” since we thought it would be ironic and deadpan funny for a team to have such a name.

**Name**: Harlee Horng

**Student Number**: s3717748

**Email Address**: s3717748@student.rmit.edu.au

**Date of Birth**: 26/12/1999

My name is Harlee Horng, born in Australia in the year of 1999. My nationality is Cambodian as both of my parents are from there. When I was younger, my parents were firm believers of the Buddhism religion, therefore, so was my older sister and me. We would attend events held at the temple on occasions, including the major Chinese New Year festival which took place annually. By the age of 8, I was able to speak the Cambodian language (Khmer) fluently, but the ability to speak it faded away as I grew up and now, I am only able to understand it. Growing up, my family consisted of my mum, dad, sister and me. This changed in the year of 2014, when my dad remarried. A year after the marriage, a little stepsister joined our family who is currently 4 years old and currently attending kindergarten. I had a standard education like most other people, consisting of; kindergarten, primary school, high school and now currently studying at university. I graduated in the year of 2017 with a low ATAR, which required me to complete a year of a diploma course before transferring to a bachelor's degree at RMIT. I acquired my first job at Maccas whilst I was in year 12 and I am still working there right now. As soon as I had enough money to afford a decent computer, I spent all my savings that I had at the time to build my computer. My hobby is playing video games on my PC. One specific game that I enjoy the most is ‘League of Legends’ which I have played consistently and constantly for 6 years.

An interesting fact about me is that I got detention on my first week of primary school because I chased other students around with a stick. Oddly enough, my personality has shifted dramatically from when I was a child. I used to be confident and outgoing, contrasted to how I am now - which is quiet, introverted and antisocial.

**Email Address**: s359772@student.rmit.edu.au

**Date of Birth**: 17/08/1997

My name is Andy Lo, was born in August of 1997. My Student ID is S399772 and my email is S3599772@student.rmit.edu.au. My family is Catholic so attending church on Sunday was a childhood memory for me. I came from Hong Kong to Australia to attend high school and then to RMIT. During this year, I will graduate from bachelor and seek for accounting job. My favourite food is noodles. My hobbies include watching YouTube videos and play mobile games. If there is more time on holiday period, I may travel to a suburb near my home and take a refreshing walk. Our group tried to think of a team name related to Asian as we have a connection with that. Even so, “Team Name” is better, I believe without any specific reason.

# Group Reflection

**What went well**
The group members did their allocated sections well and within the given time, The report formation and other related tasks such as interviews were successfully completed thanks to the group members, we were able to push through even with only 4 active members without too much of a hassle. The teamwork of this group was excellent, where each member took the initiative in getting the due tasks done even with other course assignments and projects due at the same time.

**What could be improved**
If all group members were in constant contact that would reduce the inconveniences faced by the whole team since one absent member will mean more work being allocated to everyone else which is unfair and with the high workloads already placed I believe it is imperative that each member carry their own weight, including myself.

**At least one thing that was surprising**
The level of expertise required to make any of our project ideas become a reality, the factors we have to consider as well as figuring out how to start in making this project idea. The software and the complexity of the idea determined if the project was actually achievable within the given timespan.

**At least one thing that you have learned about groups**
The level of responsibility a team leader must have is immense, there's alot of factors to consider as well as obstacles faced during the course of this project, and finding answers when you are placed on the spot as a team leader is anxiety-inducing as well as requiring a high level of tolerance and patience. All of which will be tested throughout the course of this project. Teamwork is also paramount to the successful completion of any project and without teamwork, the overall morale and efficiency of the group lowers which affects team performance.
